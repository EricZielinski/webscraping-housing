The purpose of this project is to learn how to scrape the internet.  It's something I've wanted to sink my teeth into for a long time.
My motivation for starting this was my bad experience finding student housing in the Netherlands.  The Dutch housing market is pretty bad;
it's worse if you're a student; and it's even worse if you're an international (and non-EU) student.  

So, my goal is to provide housing options that are student friendly.  Many of the aggregator websites don't have a filter for this.

This project has only just started so the functionality is minimal and the code could certainly be organized a bit more clearly.  
Eventually I'll add a frontend piece to this.  

Goals in no particular order:
1) Obtain a list of all of the brokers in the Netherlands and their websites.
2) Have this scraper work for all of them
3) Implement multithreading to speed up the scraping process
4) Look into text-based ML to see if that would work for this project
5) Incorporate tests
6) Build frontend
